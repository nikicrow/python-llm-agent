bar_chart_with_rolling_average = "Write a function that takes an input of two columns in a dataframe: x which is a column of integers that are incrementally increasing from 2 to 217 and y which is a float ranging from 13 to 19. Take these two columns and create a bar chart where x is on the x axis and y is on the y axis. Add a line plot which is a rolling average with a period of 7 data points. Add a title on the x axis 'Days since birth' and a title on the y axis 'Total hours of sleep per day'. Add a title to the chart 'Total sleep per day'. Add a legend."
histogram = "Write python code to create a histogram chart using plotly and streamlit. You are given two columns. The first column is an integer which ranges from 0 to 7, you will group the data in the histogram by this column. The second column is a float ranging from 0.5 to 3.5, this is the data that will be on the x axis of the histogram. Add a title to the chart 'Average nap duration by month' and add a title to the x axis 'nap duration'. Also add a legend so we know which colour corresponds to the numbers in the first column."
boxplot = ""
broken_barh = "Write a function that creates a plot using broken_barh from matplotlib.pyplot. This function should take three columns from a pandas dataframe. The x axis column is an integer that counts up from from 1 to 200, it is called days_since_birth. The y axis is 24 hour time of day and takes in two other columns time_24_hour which is a time in 24 hours, there are at least 2 or three of those per days_since_birth. The second that feeds into the y axis is called duration. Duration represents the time take since time_24_hour e.g. 20 minutes. The broken_barh for a given integer on the x axis will have 2-3 time_24_hour points, for example 10am, 1pm and 4pm and the duration will represent the duration of time corresponding to those times, e.g. 40 minutes, 1.5 hours, 1 hour respectively. Plot the broken_barh. Generate some data to show example usage of the function."
